## Used Software Applications: 

#### Python Programming language  
Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. 
Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. Python is a multi-paradigm programming language.  Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming. 

#### MySQL  
MySQL Database Service is a fully managed database service to deploy cloud-native applications. HeatWave, an integrated, high-performance analytics engine accelerates MySQL performance by 400x.MySQL Cluster enables users to meet the database challenges of next generation web, cloud, and communications services with uncompromising scalability, uptime and agility.

## PROJECT BACKGROUND

Nowadays there is a big trend of going digital and one of the best uses of this trend can be visualized in **Hospital Management System** where the track of numerous amount of paperwork required.

As there is much of paperwork, there is more chance of losing it in many ways like that in a fire, or misplacing some important files. So, the best use of Machines can be made in this case. 

Machines can store numerous large data on the disk and moreover just not storing, the data is safe. _So if Hospital Management system go digital they can maintain a computer system that stores all the information of the Hospital management system like Booking Enquiry, Hospital enquiry, Appointment, Searching booking and there is still more which is beyond our imagination that machine can do._

In this program I took a little step forward by implementing the above in real life situation.

##  TESTING TECHNOLOGIES 

#### White Box Testing
White-box testing (also known as clear box testing,
glass box testing, transparent box testing, and structural testing) is a method of testing software that tests
internal structures or workings of an application, as opposed to its functionality (i.e. black-box testing). In
white-box testing an internal perspective of the system,
as well as programming skills, are used to design test
cases. The tester chooses inputs to exercise paths through
the code and determine the appropriate outputs. This
is analogous to testing nodes in a circuit, e.g. in-circuit
testing (ICT). White-box testing can be applied at the
unit, integration and system levels of the software testing process. Although traditional testers tended to think
of white-box testing as being done at the unit level, it is
used for integration and system testing more frequently
today. It can test paths within a unit, paths between
units during integration, and between subsystems during
a system–level test. Though this method of test design can
uncover many errors or problems, it has the potential to
miss unimplemented parts of the specification or missing requirements.


#### Black Box Testing
Black-box testing is a method of software testing that
examines the functionality of an application without peering into its internal structures or workings. This method
of test can be applied virtually to every level of software
testing: unit, integration, system and acceptance. It typically comprises most if not all higher level testing, but
can also dominate unit testing as well. Specific knowledge of the application’s code/internal structure and programming knowledge in general is not required. The tester is aware of what the software is supposed to do but is not aware of how it does it. For instance, the tester is aware that a particular input returns
a certain, invariable output but is not aware of how the
software produces the output in the first place.
